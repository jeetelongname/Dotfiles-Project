# Dotfiles-Project

A place to aggregate all of your Dotfiles!

# This is a place to share and collaborate on Dotfiles!

I love configuring stuff but i also love copying off of others so after someone else suggested it I made this README and this repo! 

# Getting Started

this is mostly a place to browse dotfiles and experiment but if you do want to clone it!

``` shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jeetelongname/Dotfiles-Project
```

# How to add your Dotfiles

Its simple! clone this repo, add your dotfiles to a folder called your username and make a Pull request! If you have a problem with a certain configuration make an issue and tag the person who made it!
